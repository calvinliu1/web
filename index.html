<h2> What are the ingredients for a sandwich </h2>
<p> You should have bread, whether they are in pre-cut slices or in loaves (you would have to cut them), as well as the contents inside the sandwich which can be anything. Anything edible can be put inside a sandwich but 
here are some popular ingredients for your sandwich. </p>

<h2> How do you make a sandwich? </h2> 
<p> Making a sandwich isn't too hard. You simply take two pieces of bread and toast it (via toaster), if you want to. Take the toasted or non-toasted bread and lay them both down. Take your ingredients and layer them ontop one 
slice of bread. After you are satisifed with what or how much you put on top of the bread, put the second slice on top of the ingredients. </p>

<h2> What should you eat with a sanwich? </h2> 
<p> A sandwich should never be eaten alone. A sandwich should always be eaten with a side of chips or a drink. Chips simply because of the texture it offers. A change of texture when eating a sandwich can amplify the taste of 
the sandwich. A drink simply because a drink is good for anything. </p>
