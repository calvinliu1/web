<h2> What are the ingredients for a sandwich </h2>
<p> You should have bread, whether they are in pre-cut slices or in loaves (you would have to cut them), as well as the contents inside the sandwich which can be anything. Anything edible can be put inside a sandwich but 	
here are <a> <a href="https://www.care.com/c/stories/3545/10-ingredients-5-new-sandwich-ideas-from-who/">some ingredients for your sandwich</a>. Most sandwiches are eaten for lunch or breakfast. Breakfast sandwiches can 
range from something sweet like peanut butter and jam to something savory like bacon, eggs and cheese. Lunch sandwiches on the other hand are usually savory and are made with some sort of meat and some vegetables. 
Nowadays, there are even desert sandwiches such as ice cream sandwiches that are eaten after dinner or as a snack on a hot summer day.</p>

<h2> How do you make a sandwich? </h2> 
<p> Making a sandwich isn't too hard. You simply take two pieces of bread and toast it (via toaster), if you want to. Take the toasted or non-toasted bread and lay them both down. Take your ingredients and layer them on top one 
slice of bread. After you are satisifed with what or how much you put on top of the bread, put the second slice on top of the ingredients. <a> <a href="https://www.care.com/c/stories/3545/10-ingredients-5-new-sandwich-ideas-from-who/">Here are some instructions on how to make a sandwich</a>. 
Making a sandwich is easier and more simply than making, let say, a plate of fried rice. It doesn't take very long as most sandwiches are made with ingredients that do not need to be heated or cooked or are already cooked. 
This way, making a sandwich is super quick and easy as to grabing a few slices of ham and putting it on top of bread, then adding some lectures and/or tomatoes, and boom, you've got yourself a sandwich.</p>

<h2> What should you eat with a sanwich? </h2> 
<p> A sandwich should never be eaten alone. A sandwich should always be eaten with a side of chips or a drink. Chips simply because of the texture it offers. A change of texture when eating a sandwich can amplify the taste of 
the sandwich. A drink simply because a drink is good for anything. Sandwiches are easy to make and are super filling and satisfying. </p>
